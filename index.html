        <p>At first, Antonio Brown thought the shots that killed his 7-year-old son were just more fireworks. But then people started yelling, "They shot your son," and he saw Amari collapsed on the ground.</p>

        <p>"He was just down. He wasn't crying, he was speaking. 'Daddy, daddy,' " Brown said Sunday, sitting around the corner from where his son was shot hours before in the Humboldt Park neighborhood and still wearing clothes stained with the boy's blood.</p>

        <p>Brown said a friend drove him and Amari to the hospital. "I picked him up and put him in the car. I was in the back seat, I was talking to him the whole time. I was like, 'You cool, I know you cool.' "
        </p>

        <p>"Yeah, I'm cool. I'm cool," Amari answered, according to Brown.</p>

        <p>Brown said he feared his son was slipping away as he rushed for help. "He foamed at the mouth a little bit. And then I felt him get a little heavy, so I'm like, we got to do something fast."
</p>

        <p>Amari had stopped talking by the time they arrived at Stroger Hospital, and Brown handed him to the doctors and nurses. "I knew he was gonna be OK. I knew he was," Brown said. "He cool. He told me he was cool."</p>

        <p>But about 40 minutes later, a doctor came out and said Amari was dead.
        </p>

        <p>Recounting the shooting at his home in the 1100 block of North Harding Avenue, Brown said he had always seen so much of himself in the boy.</p>
         
         <p>"It was just me all over again," Brown said, his hands behind his head. "That's me all over again."</p>

    <p>    Amari was among the victims of a burst of violence across Chicago over an eight-hour stretch from Saturday night through Sunday morning. In all, three people were killed and 27 were wounded.</p>

    <p>Amari had been riding his scooter up and down his grandmother's West Side block earlier in the day Saturday while his family and neighbors celebrated the holiday grilling and enjoyed each other's company.</p>

    <p>Brown picked him up to watch fireworks at a friend's house, according to the family.</p>

    <p>The shooting happened about five minutes after the two arrived at the house as dozens of children played out front, Brown said. It was difficult to distinguish the shots from the fireworks, he said.</p>

     <p>"When it happened, it ain't like everybody ran," Brown said. "Nobody even run because we didn't know what was going on.</p>

        <p>Above the illustration were the words, "We love you Amari."</p>

        <p>In the week since Amari Brown's death, his favorite superheroes became a sign of solidarity for his friends and family, a symbol of the innocence of a boy whose life was cut short by gun violence. Dozens wore Ninja Turtles T-shirts to his funeral Saturday, and green balloons were fashioned into the shapes of Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo.

        <p>Amari was among the victims of a burst of violence across Chicago over an eight-hour stretch that night, in which three people were killed and 27 wounded. A violent Fourth of July weekend left 10 people dead and 55 wounded.</p>

        <p>Family and friends who spoke at Amari's funeral echoed his long list of charming qualities: his million-dollar smile, his love for singers Lil Kemo and DLow, his inability to resist candy, doughnuts and popcorn, his deep spirituality, and his aspiration to become a police officer when he grew up, in order to protect his family.</p>

        <p>"Please don't tell me you know how I feel, unless you have lost your child too," wrote Amari's father, Antonio, in a poem read aloud at the service. "Please don't tell me my broken heart will heal, because that's just not true."
              </p>

        <p>Dahlia Trusty, Amari's older cousin who fondly remembers him breaking her mirror when he helped her move into college, said she worked to prevent him from being another statistic.
        </p>

     <p>"Oh, Amari, I love you," she told the congregation. "I love you despite my sadness. I'm so happy for you because you get to be with Jesus."</p>
